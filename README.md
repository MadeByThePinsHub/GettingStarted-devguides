# Dev Guides - Getting Started

Welcome to your first **Dev Guides** on the Pins team! This assignment is your fist assignment in our **Dev Guides** classroom and this aims to learn the basics about Git and GitHub and learn you how to coding. Once joined to our main GitHub organixzation, you'll also grant access to our assignments and classrooms.

To get started, [:tv: watch your first video here first.](https://youtu.be)

## Setting up your workspace
- Sign in or create your [GitHub account](https://github.com) first.
- Accept the assignment by [clicking here](https://classroom.github.com/a/yDegC1Dc). (Accept permissions for the GitHub Classroom OAuth app if you're on GitHub Classroom for the first time.)
- Once accepted, GitHub elves will create your own individual repository from [an template repository](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/GettingStarted-devguides/). When done, access them at `https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/dev-guides-gettingstarted-yourusernamehere` where `yourusername` is your GitHUb username.
- Additonally, install Git and Atom for your computer to get things started as we're using them throughout the assignment. ([See this mini guide](https://github.com/github-campus-advisors/Campus-Advisor-Training#to-get-started) for more info.)
- (Optional) Join our community on [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com) using the class code `4as5kr`.

## Improving the `GettingStarted-devguides` repository
It is beneficial that you take advantage of the resources presented to you, but Andrei Jiroh would also recommend that if you find instances where things can be improved, then please create an issue in the original repository [here](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/GettingStarted-devguides/issues). If you are not familiar with issues in GitHub, no worries, you will learn about them soon.

> Spoiler alert: While we adopt GitHub's [Campus Advisor Training](https://github.com/github-campus-advisors/Campus-Advisor-Training) repository, we wrote them from strach.

## Emoji Help

:tv: - Watch an video

:notebook: - Read an quick review Markdown file or do an assignment.

## Working on GitLab?
We'll working to make this available on GitLab soon, but for now, let's focus your minds on GitHub first.
